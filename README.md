# git-ssh-sign-assist

This is a simple utility to assist with setting up SSH signing with git/GitHub, because I always forget how to do it lol.
Note that this is a 'run once' script meant for a freshly installed system, but it can detect an SSH key if you already have one present.

## Why would you go out of your way to script such a simple thing?

Because I have so many computers that this will actually save me time.
